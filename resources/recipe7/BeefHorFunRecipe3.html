    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Preparation Method</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Drizzle the sweet and light soy sauces all over the noodles and mix
        thoroughly, without breaking up the noodles. This is best done with your
        hands. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slice the beef up thinly and add all the other ingredients to the beef
        strips and mix thoroughly. Again, best done with your hands. Set aside
        to marinate.
      </li>
      <li>Slice up the squid tubes into thin rings.</li>
      <li>
        Clean and de-vein the prawns, leaving the shells or at least the tails
        intact. The shells help to add flavour to the hor fun sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        If your vegetables are large, cut them up in two, separating the green
        leaves from the stems. Otherwise, leave them whole.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Cooking Method</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat 1 tsp of vegetable oil in a wok over a high heat and fry the garlic
        for 15 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Throw in the noodles and fry for 2 minutes, tossing and stirring
        constantly. At the end of the 2 minutes, some of the noodles will be
        sticking to each other, that’s when you know they’re done. Dish up onto
        a serving plate and keep warm on the stovetop as you continue cooking
        everything else.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the same wok, heat the 1 Tbsp of oil, on medium high heat and quickly
        fry the beef strips for 2-3 minutes. You want the beef to be just
        cooked, still slightly pink on the inside. However, if you prefer your
        beef well done, go ahead and do so. Tip the cooked beef strips over the
        noodles, along with any juices and fat from the wok. Keep warm.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the same wok, with no added oil, wilt the vegetables for about 20-30
        seconds, you’re going for a dark, glossy green. Tip the vegetables onto
        the beef and noodles.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour your chicken stock, the light soy sauce, the dark soy sauce, the
        oyster sauce and the sugar into the wok and bring to a boil on high
        heat.
      </li>
      <li>When it’s boiling, add the prawns, cook for a minute.</li>
      <li>Add the squid, cook for a minute.</li>
      <li>
        Add the cornflour mix stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens.
      </li>
      <li>
        Take off the heat, drizzle the sesame oil all over and sprinkle a dash
        of the white pepper.
      </li>
      <li>Pour all over the noodles and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>NOTES</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
      *Sauté pan: If you happen to own a nonstick or cast-iron pan, I would
      recommend it for this recipe. But that said, any pan that you have can
      work — you may just have to be a bit more vigilant with stirring so that
      the rice and eggs don’t stick.
