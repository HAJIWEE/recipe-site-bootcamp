INGREDIENTS
200 gm Beef
100 gm Bean Sprouts
5 slices Bentong Ginger
1 Yellow Onion Small
4-5 stalks Chye Sim
1 stalk Spring Onion
100 ml Oil For deep-frying the beef
2 tsp Chopped Garlic
1/2 tsp Salt
1 tsp Dark Soy Sauce

DIRECTIONS
PREPARATION METHOD
Wash beef and cut into slices by across the grain of the meat.
Marinate the beef in the marinade ingredients while preparing the rest of the ingredients.
Peel the ginger and cut into slices. Peel the onion and cut into thin wedges. Wash and cut the spring onion into 5 cm lengths
Wash the Chye Sim, then separate the leaves from the stems. For the stems, remove the root end and peel off the outer skin which can be quite fibrous, then cut into 5 cm lengths.
Remove the head and root ends of the beansprouts, then rinse and drain dry.
COOKING METHOD
Add 100ml of oil into a wok over high heat, then fry the beef for 1-2 minutes until 80% cooked. 
To achieve a wok hei effect, heat up a pan to smoking point, then add in 2 TBsp of the oil used to fry the beef. 
Add in the Hor Fun, light soy sauce, black vinegar and dark soy sauce. Toss the Hor Fun in the wok ( or use chopsticks) until it's evenly coated with the sauces, and is slightly charred, then transfer to a plate.
Heat up 1 TBsp of beef oil in the wok over medium heat, then add in the ginger and chopped garlic and fry until aromatic.
Next add in the sliced onions and chye sim stalks and fry for a minute, then add in the chye sim leaves and 1/2 tsp of salt (or to taste)
Add back the pre-cooked beef, 1 tsp of dark soy sauce, beansprouts, spring onions and hor fun and fry, mixing well until the beef is cooked.
Transfer to a dish and garnish with some cut chilli (optional).
