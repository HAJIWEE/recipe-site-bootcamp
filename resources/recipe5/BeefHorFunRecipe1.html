    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Preparation Method</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Wash beef and cut into slices by across the grain of the meat.</li>
      <li>
        Marinate the beef in the marinade ingredients while preparing the rest
        of the ingredients.
      </li>
      <li>Peel the ginger and cut into slices.</li>
      <li>Peel the onion and cut into thin wedges.</li>
      <li>Wash and cut the spring onion into 5 cm lengths</li>
      <li>Wash the Chye Sim, then separate the leaves from the stems.</li>
      <li>
        For the stems, remove the root end and peel off the outer skin which can
        be quite fibrous, then cut into 5 cm lengths.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the head and root ends of the beansprouts, then rinse and drain
        dry.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Cooking Method</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Add 100ml of oil into a wok over high heat</li>
      <li>fry the beef for 1-2 minutes until 80% cooked.</li>
      <li>
        To achieve a wok hei effect, heat up a pan to smoking point, then add in
        2 TBsp of the oil used to fry the beef.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add in the Hor Fun, light soy sauce, black vinegar and dark soy sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Toss the Hor Fun in the wok ( or use chopsticks) until it's evenly
        coated with the sauces, and is slightly charred, then transfer to a
        plate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat up 1 TBsp of beef oil in the wok over medium heat, then add in the
        ginger and chopped garlic and fry until aromatic.
      </li>
      <li>
        Next add in the sliced onions and chye sim stalks and fry for a minute,
        then add in the chye sim leaves and 1/2 tsp of salt (or to taste)
      </li>
      <li>
        Add back the pre-cooked beef, 1 tsp of dark soy sauce, beansprouts,
        spring onions and hor fun and fry, mixing well until the beef is cooked.
      </li>
      <li>Transfer to a dish and garnish with some cut chilli (optional).</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>NOTES</h3>

    <p>
      *Sauté pan: If you happen to own a nonstick or cast-iron pan, I would
      recommend it for this recipe. But that said, any pan that you have can
      work — you may just have to be a bit more vigilant with stirring so that
      the rice and eggs don’t stick.
