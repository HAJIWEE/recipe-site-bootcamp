    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <hr />
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat 1/2 tablespoon of butter in a large sauté pan* over medium-high
        heat until melted.
      </li>
      <li>Add egg, and cook until scrambled, stirring occasionally.</li>
      <li>Remove egg, and transfer to a separate plate.</li>
      <li>
        Add an additional 1 tablespoon butter to the pan and heat until melted.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add carrots, onion, peas and garlic, and season with a generous pinch of
        salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sauté for about 5 minutes or until the onion and carrots are soft.
      </li>
      <li>
        Increase heat to high, add in the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons of butter,
        and stir until melted.
      </li>
      <li>
        Immediately add the rice, green onions, soy sauce and oyster sauce (if
        using), and stir until combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Continue sautéing for an additional 3 minutes to fry the rice, stirring
        occasionally. (I like to let the rice rest for a bit between stirs so
        that it can crisp up on the bottom.)
      </li>
      <li>Then add in the eggs and stir to combine.</li>
      <li>
        Remove from heat, and stir in the sesame oil until combined. Taste and
        season with extra soy sauce, if needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve immediately, or refrigerate in a sealed container for up to 3
        days.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>NOTES</h3>

    <p>
      *Sauté pan: If you happen to own a nonstick or cast-iron pan, I would
      recommend it for this recipe. But that said, any pan that you have can
      work — you may just have to be a bit more vigilant with stirring so that
      the rice and eggs don’t stick.
