    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Preperation</h3>
    <hr />
    <ol>
      <li>
        To prepare the day-old cooked rice, remove it from the refrigerator and
        heat it in the microwave until it's room temperature or slightly warm.
        If you are using 2 servings of freshly cooked rice, transfer the hot
        rice to a baking sheet. Spread it out and let it cool completely. This
        will remove the moisture from the rice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut the white part of the green onion into rounds and the green part
        diagonally. Keep the white and green parts separate and set aside.
        Reserve a few green slices for the garnish.
      </li>
      <li>Dice the ham into square pieces ½ inch (1.3 cm) wide.</li>
      <li>Crack and whisk the egg in a bowl.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>To cook the Fried Rice</h3>
    <hr />
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make sure all the ingredients are prepped and ready to go, as this dish
        cooks quickly. Heat the wok (or a large frying pan) on medium-high heat.
        Once it’s hot, add half the oil and swirl it around to make sure it
        coats the entire surface of the wok. Add the beaten egg to the hot wok.
        After a few seconds, the egg will start to float on top of the oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        With the blunt end of a spatula, swirl the loosely set egg around the
        pan to keep it fluffy while continuing to cook it. When the bottom of
        the egg is set but the top is still a bit runny and not quite fully
        cooked, transfer it to a plate. We do not want to overcook the egg at
        this stage.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the other half of the oil to the pan. Then, add the ham and white
        part of the chopped green onion. Stir-fry and coat well with the oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the cooked and cooled rice to the wok. With the spatula, use a
        slicing motion to separate the rice clumps without mashing or breaking
        the rice grains. Combine it with the ham mixture and continue to toss
        the rice so it is coated with oil and develops a nice char.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the cooked egg back to the wok and break it into smaller pieces
        while you combine it with the rice. If some of the rice sticks to the
        wok (it happens when there's not enough oil), you can scrape it off
        easily if you're using a well-seasoned or nonstick wok. This creates a
        nice charred flavor. You may need to add more oil if you're using a
        stainless steel pan, as the rice tends to stick more.
      </li>
      <li>Season the rice with salt and white pepper.</li>
      <li>
        Add the soy sauce and toss to distribute it throughout the rice. The key
        action here is to continuously toss the fried rice in the air to keep it
        from clumping instead of leaving it a sticky mass clustered at the
        bottom of the wok. Turning and tossing the rice in the air also helps
        develop a smoky flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the green part of the chopped green onion. Taste the fried rice and
        adjust the seasoning if needed. After tossing the rice a few more times,
        transfer it to a plate.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>NOTES</h3>

    <h4>To Serve</h4>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Fried rice at Chinese restaurants in Japan is often served in a dome
      shape. If you'd like to serve it this way, fill a rice bowl with the fried
      rice, pat it down lightly to compact it, and invert it onto a plate. Fill
      the rice bowl again for the other plate. Sprinkle the reserved sliced
      green onion on top, and serve. To Store You can store the leftovers in an
      airtight container and keep in the refrigerator for up to 2 days and in
      the freezer for up to a month.
